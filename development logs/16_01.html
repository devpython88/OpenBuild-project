<h3>What's the exciting feature?</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bushy leaves</li>
        <p>Tree leaves now don't collide and are bushy</p>
    <li>Merging</li>
        <p>Now there are certain blocks that aren't normally obtainable <br>
        You will have to use the new Merging menu (<kb>I</kb>) to merge other blocks to create them. <br>
        The merge menu also has some special items such as `Player Torch` and `Fire`</p>

        <p>The current recipes are <ul>
    <li>Dedris Ash: Dedris Flower x Fire</li>
    <li>Torch Lamp: Player Torch x Lamp Pole</li>
    <li>Oral Dust (Gets brighter at night): Oral Flower x Fire</li>
    <li>Dedris Core: Dedris Ash x Torch Lamp</li>

        <p>Now I only spoiled the Oral Dust for you but you'll have to find out what the other blocks do yourself!</p>
        <p>Yes, The unlocked items are saved with the world, Though it is still backward compatible with older worlds</p>
</ul></p>
</ol>
