            There are four inventory slots, They are accessible with number key 1, 2, 3 and 4 <br>
            Inventory allows you to build things faster as you don't have to constantly switch blocks</p>

        <p>Now there is a interaction circle around the player for interaction. <br>
            And Dynamites now also use a circle which means they have a larger explosion radius!</p>

        Which means modder's can now package their mods in ZIPs you can just extract</p>
    <li>playSound function in scripts</li>
        <p>This function takes a sound name and plays the sound</p>
