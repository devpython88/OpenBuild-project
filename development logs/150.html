<h2>Environmental Update!</h2>
<h3>This update changes a lot of things of the environment of OpenBuild!</h3>


<h3>What's new?</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Flowers Fields</li>
        <p>Now you might stumble across a good unique flower field somewhere</p>
    <li>Pebbles</li>
        <p>Pebbles. There are also pebbles that generate naturally</p>
    <li>Grass</li>
        <p>Not the Grass Block, Just grass. Generates randomly</p>
    <li>Structure Random X and Y</li>
        <p>Now if you set the x or y of a block in a structure.
            <br>You can split multiple x or y values using `:` so that when loading the structure,
            <br>A random value from the specified values is chosen!</p>
</ol>

<h3>A little surprise for modders</h3>
<p>The game now has a UI table in its scripting API, Right now it only has a Button class
    <br>That's because the update primarily focuses on Environment
    <br>You can install the latest PDF guide to see how to use it.
    <br>Just a side note here, Make sure ALL your UI elements are created IN THE scriptLoaded otherwise the game will crash</p>


<h3>Feel free to suggest anything</h3>
